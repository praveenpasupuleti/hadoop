Hello

In This week I have involved in Incident management, Knowledge Management for all hadoop and Ab initio Platform issues.

I have constantly monitored the Hadoop and Ab initio platform issues and completed Resolving those. 

Some of the SOR applications got failures like Technical Data Quality issues, Eegan Time out issues. I resolved these issues by coordinating with some precise Groups and Peoples.

Apart from Hadoop there were some Ab initio issues like Jobs has failed due to time out problems. These incidents were also resolved by communicating with owners for those jobs.
